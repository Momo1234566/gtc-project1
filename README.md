# Hotel Booking Data Cleaning & EDA Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preprocessing on a hotel bookings dataset. The workflow is structured into clear phases, with code and outputs demonstrating each step.

## 📊 Phase 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Quality Assessment

- **Data Loading & Overview:**  
  The dataset is loaded and inspected with `.info()` and `.head()` to understand its structure and types.
- **Summary Statistics:**  
  Used `.describe()` to get statistical summaries for all columns.
- **Missing Values:**  
  - Calculated missing value counts and percentages for every column.
  - Identified major missing data issues:  
    - `company` (94% missing)
    - `agent` (13% missing)
    - `country` (0.4% missing)
    - `children` (nearly complete)
- **Visualizations:**  
  - Plots for missing values and key statistics.
  - Pie, bar, and line plots to understand guest composition, family bookings, and seasonal trends.

## 🧹 Phase 2: Data Cleaning

- **Handling Missing Values:**  
  - For `company` and `agent`: Replaced missing values with `0`.
  - For `country`: Imputed missing values with the mode (most frequent country).
  - For `children`: Imputed missing values with `0`.
- **Removing Duplicates:**  
  - Detected and dropped exact duplicate rows.
- **Outlier Handling:**  
  - Capped extreme values in the `adr` column (values > 1000 were set to 1000).
- **Data Type Fixes:**  
  - Converted date columns to proper datetime formats.
  - Created a new `arrival_date` column for easier date-based analysis.

## 🏗️ Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

- **New Feature Creation:**  
  - `total_guests` = adults + children + babies  
  - `total_nights` = stays_in_weekend_nights + stays_in_week_nights  
  - `is_family_flag` = 'yes' if children or babies > 0, else 'no'
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:**  
  - One-hot encoding for low-cardinality categorical columns (e.g., meal, market_segment).
  - Frequency encoding for high-cardinality columns (e.g., country).
- **Data Leakage Prevention:**  
  - Dropped columns `reservation_status` and `reservation_status_date` to prevent data leakage.
- **Data Splitting:**  
  - Final cleaned data was split into training and test sets (80/20 split).

## 💡 Notable Code Steps

- Used `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data handling and visualization.
- Outlier and missing value analysis was performed systematically with visual and tabular checks.
- All cleaning and transformations are reproducible in the notebook cells.

## 📝 Usage

To run the analysis:
1. Open `GTC_Project1.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Ensure `hotel_bookings.csv` is in the correct path or update the path in the notebook.
3. Run each cell in order for a step-by-step walkthrough from raw data to train/test split.

## 🧩 Main Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## 🗒️ Notes

- All key data cleaning decisions, including imputation strategies and outlier handling, are justified and visible in the notebook.
- The notebook prepares the data for downstream machine learning tasks or further analysis.
